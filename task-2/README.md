# Task 2
Create a web page that fetches data from the [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/)

## Requirements
Up to date web browser (Firefox recommended)
Your browser needs to have javascript enabled

## Usage
Just open index.html with your browser and navigate to Glimpse of Wonders(page 1) or Command and Conquer(page 2). You can also open glimpse-of-wonders.html or command-and-conquer.html directly from the "src" folder.

In the case of Command and Conquer, it uses an array to store the data but first has do to calls for the list of breeds and then the list of sub-breeds for every breed, it may be slow depending on server response time. After that every change is done locally and you can see the effects immidiatly. Note: new dogs are added to the end of the list.
